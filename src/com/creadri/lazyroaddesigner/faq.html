    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>LazyDesigner is a tool made exclusively for LazyRoad, a Bukkit plug-in for Minecraft.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h1>F.A.Q.</h1>
    <h2>How do I make a road ?</h2>
    <p>Go into the road top menu. Click on &quot;New Road&quot;. Then enter a name without spaces and click OK. It will make an empty road. You have then to complete it by adding new road parts !</p>
    
    <h2>How do I make a pillar ?</h2>
    <p>Go into the pillar top menu. Click on &quot;New Pillar&quot;. Then enter a name without spaces and click OK. It will make an empty pillar. You have then to complete it by adding new pillar parts !    </p>
    <p>Caution, Pillars are builds upside-down!</p>
    
    <h2>How do I erase a block or fill it with air in the editor ?</h2>
    <p>Right click on it, it will place an AIR block.</p>
    
    <h2>What is the &quot;Keep Value&quot; element in the material palette?</h2>
    <p>It is a value used in LazyRoad. Basically, when having a &quot;Keep Value&quot; block, LazyRoad won't overwrite the existing block in the Minecraft world. Useful when building tunnels</p>
    
    <h2>Saving roads don't work !</h2>
    <p>It works, the only thing is that the file name is automatically created. So when saving, only select a directory, don't try to enter a file name !</p>
    
    <h2>How do stairs works?</h2>
    <p>Stairs are only blocks placed over the road when you go up or down with the road. When you are building a road and you go up one block, LazyRoad will make the road normally, then it will add the stairs on the road freshly made. Usually stairs are made out of steps or stairs (for stairs, use North direction). It isn't advised to make them more than 1 block height. Also it should be the same with as the road.</p>
    
    <h2>Why is there North, South, West, East indication on some blocks?</h2>
    <p>Torches, Stairs and some other blocks have directions. As for the stairs, it can face the 4 directions. You have to keep in mind that the default location is North! LazyRoad will adapt those direction values when building.</p>
    
    <h2>How are the directions handled by LazyRoad?</h2>
    <p>Torches and Stairs have directions. LazyRoad can force those directions to build something neat. The default direction is North. So North is forward, South Backwards, West Right and East Left. You don't have to build different roads depending on the direction you want to build, LazyRoad is smart enough to translate the directional values.</p>
    
    <h2>While building in-game, torches do not get placed correctly!</h2>
    <p>This is a bug, Minecraft does not allow placing torches in a given way if there are no blocks placed for the torches. LazyRoad does place block per block and thus, it can happen to build torches before the block. At the moment, just place bottom torches, that should work fairly well.</p>
    
    <h2>I don't understand anything about how to make a road !</h2>
    <p>Well, I have to admit, this GUI editor isn't the most user-friendly tool ever made. Open an existing road to see how it is made. There are also some video tutorials out there. Search though YouTube and you may even get a Tutorial in your language.</p>
